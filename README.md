## About
As a part of a new product trial, Tesla has ordered ordered heavy duty coil springs from multiple suppliers. The quality team has completed a series of weight tests to help evaluate the coil springs. They have supplied us with the test data they collected.

A quality team member explains the tests they completed as the following:
> We start with a spring with no weight on it and measured the distance to the bottom of the spring from the top of the stand. We record this measurement as "start_measurement_m". We then hang a known mass on the spring and wait for it to stop moving. Again, we measure the distance from the bottom of the spring to the top of the stand. We record this measurement as "end_measurement_m". We hung a series of increasingly heavier weights on the spring, measuring the spring each time and recording the results into a file. We repeated this process for multiple springs.

### Hooke's law of elasticity
The magnitude of the force required to change the length of a spring is directly proportional to the spring constant and the displacement of the spring.

_f = kx_

The force, F, stored in a spring is linearly related to the distance the spring has been stretched (or compressed). When a spring is stretched it exhibits spri ng displacement, x, this is the difference between the spring length after force is applied and the spring length with no force applied. The All springs have an elastic limit, beyond which the law fails. (Those of you who have stretched a Slinky too far know this all too well). The constant of proportionality, k, is called the spring constant. If the spring is stiff (like the ones needed for our new product), k is large. If the spring is weak (like the spring in a ballpoint pen) k is small. Knowing the value k of a particular spring can be matter of some importance.

The force, F, being exerted on the spring is equal to the mass, m, multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, g (9.81 m/s2), so we substitute m*g for F:
