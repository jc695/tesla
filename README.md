## About
As a part of a new product trial, Tesla has ordered ordered heavy duty coil springs from multiple suppliers. The quality team has completed a series of weight tests to help evaluate the coil springs. They have supplied us with the test data they collected.

A quality team member explains the tests they completed as the following:
> We start with a spring with no weight on it and measured the distance to the bottom of the spring from the top of the stand. We record this measurement as "start_measurement_m". We then hang a known mass on the spring and wait for it to stop moving. Again, we measure the distance from the bottom of the spring to the top of the stand. We record this measurement as "end_measurement_m". We hung a series of increasingly heavier weights on the spring, measuring the spring each time and recording the results into a file. We repeated this process for multiple springs.
